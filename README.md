# karlandrefilms 🎥✨

**karlandrefilms** is a student-led multimedia and AI research initiative that merges independent filmmaking, photography, and experimental digital storytelling with open-source tools and emerging AI technology.

## 🎯 Project Focus

- High-quality video and photography production using open-source software
- Research into generative AI models and their creative applications
- Creation of hybrid media content for education, art, and social commentary
- Experimentation with tools like Stable Diffusion, Whisper, and open-source video editors

## 💡 Why This Matters

- Democratize access to AI-assisted creativity
- Share findings and workflows openly with others in the creative community
- Push the boundaries of storytelling in the digital era

## 🔧 Funding Needs

This project is currently seeking funding to support:

- High-performance PC build for AI rendering and media editing
- Licenses and subscriptions to essential open-source AI tools
- Student research time dedicated to sharing open workflows and tutorials

**Total Requested: $10,000**
